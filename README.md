## About
<hr>

Project developed during phase 3 - Advancing in HTML and CSS, in the explorer course [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat).

The idea of ​​this project is to put into practice everything that was seen in the third phase of the explorer.

The scenery was set up with CSS keyframe animations to make the moles appear in the field.

I made some improvements with javascript, where the moles come out in different holes and can even come out in more than one hole.
